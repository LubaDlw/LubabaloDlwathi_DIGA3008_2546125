      <h1>BLOG WEEK 2: Reflecting on Hypertext Revolution and Its Relevance Today</h1>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Moulthrop's "You Say You Want a Revolution?" and Today's Internet</h2>
        <p>Stuart Moulthrop's 1991 paper "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" presents a fascinating perspective on hypertext that remains remarkably relevant to our current digital landscape. Reading this paper three decades after its publication, I'm struck by how prescient Moulthrop's observations were about the transformative potential of hypertext and how accurately he predicted many aspects of our current internet experience.</p>
        <p>Moulthrop viewed hypertext as a revolutionary medium that could fundamentally change how we create, consume, and interact with information. He explored this through McLuhan's tetrad of media effects, examining what hypertext enhances, obsolesces, retrieves, and reverses into. This framework helps us understand not just the technical aspects of hypertext but its broader cultural and social implications.</p>

        <h2>Hypertext's Continued Revolution</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The democratization of publishing</strong>: Moulthrop saw hypertext as potentially breaking down the barriers between authors and readers, creating a more participatory information ecosystem. Today's social media platforms, blogs, and content creation tools have realized this vision, allowing anyone to become a publisher.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The challenge to traditional narrative</strong>: Moulthrop discussed how hypertext disrupts linear narrative structures. We see this throughout the internet today—from the non-linear way we consume news through our feeds to the branching narratives in interactive media.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The blurring of boundaries</strong>: Moulthrop suggested hypertext would blur boundaries between different types of media and information. Today's internet is a testament to this, with multimedia content, transmedia storytelling, and the integration of text, images, video, and interactive elements across platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The tension between control and freedom</strong>: Perhaps most relevant is Moulthrop's exploration of the tension between the liberating potential of hypertext and the push for control from established institutions. This tension continues to define our digital landscape, from debates about net neutrality to concerns about platform monopolies and algorithmic curation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In further support of these observations, recent academic research available through IEEE Xplore examines the evolving interplay between hypertext and digital media. This work reinforces the enduring impact of early hypertext theories and highlights how these foundational ideas continue to influence discussions about media, technology, and control (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9617199/citations?tabFilter=papers#citations" target="_blank">IEEE Xplore</a>).</p>
        <p>What's particularly striking is how Moulthrop recognized that hypertext wouldn't simply replace old media but would transform and be transformed by existing cultural forces. We see this playing out as traditional media institutions adapt to the digital age while still trying to maintain certain power structures.</p>

        <h2>The Unfulfilled Promise</h2>
        <p>However, not all of Moulthrop's revolutionary vision has been realized. He imagined hypertext as a means of creating more active, engaged readers who would participate in the construction of meaning. While we do see more participation in content creation, much of our internet experience has become increasingly passive and algorithmically determined. The promise of hypertext as a tool for critical thinking and active engagement with information remains partially unfulfilled, making Moulthrop's paper not just an interesting historical document but a reminder of the internet's unrealized potential.</p>

        <h2>My Website Development Process</h2>
        
        <h3>Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h3>
        <p>When developing my website, I've given careful consideration to both the folder structure and URL scheme. I believe a well-organized file system not only makes development more efficient but also creates more intuitive and meaningful URLs for users.</p>
        <p>My folder structure is organized with a clear separation between main content, blog posts, and assets. I've created a logical hierarchy that keeps HTML files separate from media and styling files, making it easier to maintain and update the site. The structure is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new content, particularly in the blogs directory where I'll continue to add new posts throughout the course.</p>
        <p>For my URL scheme, I aimed for clarity and simplicity. Main pages are accessed directly from the root, while blog posts follow a consistent pattern. This approach creates URLs that are descriptive, consistent, and future-proof, accommodating growth without major reorganization.</p>

        <h3>Initial Wireframes and Design Concepts</h3>
        <p>My initial wireframes for the portfolio home page focus on creating an immediate visual impact while providing clear navigation. I'm planning to use a grid layout for featured projects, with large, high-quality images that serve as entry points to more detailed project pages.</p>
        <p>For the blog section, I'm experimenting with a book-like interface as mentioned in my Week 2 blog. The wireframe shows a two-page spread design that mimics the experience of flipping through a physical book, complete with pagination controls at the bottom.</p>
        <p>My design thinking centers around creating distinct visual identities for different sections of the site while maintaining overall cohesion. The game design portfolio will have more playful, dynamic elements, while the software development section will emphasize clean, minimal design with a focus on functionality.</p>

        <h3>Inspirational References</h3>
        <p>I've been collecting references from various sources to inspire different aspects of my website:</p>

        <h2>Interaction and the World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>Building on my reflections from Week 1 about Turing's ideas and the evolution of the internet, I've been thinking more deeply about what interaction means in the context of the web.</p>
        <p>Interaction on the web is fundamentally about dialogue—a conversation between users and digital systems. This dialogue can take many forms, from the simple act of clicking a link to complex, multi-step processes like creating content or engaging with interactive visualizations.</p>
        <p>What makes web interaction unique is its potential for non-linearity and user agency. Unlike traditional media where the experience is predetermined, the web allows users to chart their own paths through information. This relates directly to Moulthrop's ideas about hypertext as a revolutionary medium that challenges traditional narrative structures.</p>
        <p>For my website, I'm approaching interaction as an opportunity to create meaningful connections between users and my work. This means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intentional pathways</strong>: Creating clear navigation that guides users through my portfolio while still allowing for exploration.</li>
          <li><strong>Meaningful feedback</strong>: Ensuring that interactive elements respond in ways that feel natural and informative.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive disclosure</strong>: Layering information so users can choose how deeply to engage with each project.</li>
          <li><strong>Contextual interactions</strong>: Designing different interaction patterns for different types of content (games vs. software vs. visual design).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The evolution of web interaction from simple hyperlinks to complex, application-like experiences mirrors the broader transformation of the internet—from a document-sharing platform to a rich, dynamic medium. As Moulthrop suggested, this evolution hasn't just changed how we access information—it has transformed how we think about and relate to it.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the web has become a prosthetic for human cognition—extending our ability to remember, connect ideas, and create. Good interaction design acknowledges this relationship, crafting interfaces that feel like natural extensions of our thought processes rather than obstacles to overcome.</p>
        <p>As I continue developing my website, I'm keeping these ideas at the forefront, aiming to create an experience that's not just visually appealing but also intellectually and emotionally engaging—a small-scale realization of the revolutionary potential Moulthrop saw in hypertext three decades ago.</p>
