                <p>Exploring GitHub Pages, analyzing Turing's groundbreaking 1950 paper, and examining hypertext theory in relation to our modern digital landscape.</p>
                
                <h2>Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages</h2>
                <p>Setting up GitHub and publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages was a straightforward experience. The process involved creating a repository, configuring the appropriate settings, and pushing my HTML files to the main branch. What I found particularly valuable was how GitHub abstracts away the complexity of web hosting while still providing powerful version control features. Being able to deploy something on the internet is very exciting and I look forward to creating much more and putting out full-on projects through GitHub.</p>
                
                <h2>Reflection on Readings: Turing's 1950 Paper and the Internet Today</h2>
                <p>Reading Alan Turing's <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em> (1950) was a fascinating experience. In his paper, Turing proposed the idea of machines being capable of thinking, introducing what we now call the Turing Test. While the paper was written decades before the internet as we know it, its implications are still relevant today.</p>
                
                <p>Diving deeper into Turing's paper, I was struck by his methodical dismantling of objections to machine intelligence. His famous "imitation game" setup, where a human interrogator attempts to determine which of two unseen participants is a machine and which is human, presents a compelling operational definition of intelligence that sidesteps philosophical debates about consciousness. Turing's approach feels remarkably modern in its focus on observable behavior rather than internal mechanisms, a pragmatism that resonates with current approaches to AI evaluation.</p>
                
                <p>Particularly prescient was Turing's acknowledgment that machines might think differently from humans, noting that "the interrogator might not get the right conclusion about which was which." This insight anticipated today's reality where AI systems often produce unexpected solutions that don't follow human reasoning patterns. For example, AlphaGo's famous "Move 37" against Lee Sedol in 2016 was initially thought to be a mistake by human experts but proved to be brilliant, showcasing exactly the kind of machine thinking that Turing predicted might confound human judges.</p>
                
                <p>With AI chatbots, recommendation algorithms, and machine learning models shaping our digital experiences, we see Turing's ideas come to life. The modern internet is driven by intelligent systems that personalize content, predict user behavior, and automate complex tasks. My experience with GitHub reflects this evolution, automation in version control, AI-powered code suggestions (like GitHub Copilot), and seamless deployment processes that make development more efficient.</p>
                
                <h2>Hypertext Theory and Today's Internet</h2>
                <p>Exploring the theoretical underpinnings of hypertext reveals fascinating connections to our contemporary digital experience. Vannevar Bush's 1945 essay "As We May Think" introduced the concept of the "memex," a theoretical proto-hypertext system designed to supplement human memory by allowing users to create trails of linked information. This revolutionary concept predated the web by decades but anticipated its fundamental structure.</p>
                
                <p>Ted Nelson, who coined the term "hypertext" in the 1960s, envisioned a far more radical system than what eventually emerged. His Xanadu project proposed a network where documents would be perpetually accessible, with visible bi-directional links, version tracking, and a micropayment system for authors, a vision that remains partially unrealized even today.</p>
                
                <h2>My Goals for This Course</h2>
                <p>This course is an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of web development, software engineering, and the broader implications of technology. My goals include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Gaining proficiency in version control and collaborative coding using GitHub, particularly focusing on branching strategies and pull request workflows that facilitate team development.</li>
                    <li>Sharpening my foundational knowledge in web design, with specific attention to responsive design principles and accessibility standards that ensure inclusive user experiences.</li>
                    <li>Developing a critical perspective on how web technologies shape and are shaped by social factors, exploring the ethical dimensions of design choices.</li>
                    <li>Building practical skills in modern web development frameworks and tools that will translate directly to professional environments.</li>
                    <li>Creating a portfolio of work that demonstrates both technical competency and thoughtful engagement with the theoretical aspects of web development.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="blog-title p-name">WEEK 2 BLOG: Hypertext, Interaction, and the Internet Today</h2>
            <div class="blog-date dt-published">February 24, 2025</div>
            <div class="blog-body e-content">
                <p>Reflections on Moulthrop's revolutionary ideas, folder structure & URL decisions, initial wireframe concepts, user flow, and interaction theory on the modern web.</p>
                
                <h2>Reflecting on Moulthrop, S. (2003) "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)"</h2>
                <p>Moulthrop's work invites us to reconsider the promises of hypertext in transforming the way we interact with media. Even though his paper originally focused on hypertext as a revolution in how information is consumed and created, the underlying ideas speak powerfully to the internet today. By applying McLuhan's tetrad of media effects—enhancement, obsolescence, retrieval, and reversal—Moulthrop anticipated many of the tensions we now experience in digital communication.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How does it speak to the Internet today?</strong> Moulthrop's foresight is evident in the democratization of publishing, the non-linearity of digital narratives, and the ongoing tension between user freedom and algorithmic control. As we grapple with both the benefits and pitfalls of modern platforms, his framework provides a valuable lens through which to assess our digital environment.</p>
                
                <h2>Folder Structure and URL Scheme: Decisions & Insights</h2>
                <p>In building my website, thoughtful consideration has been given to both the folder structure and URL scheme. Maintaining a clean, scalable system is essential for efficient development and for ensuring an intuitive user experience.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Folder Structure:</strong> The site's files are organized into clear directories—<code>index.html</code> in the root, a dedicated <code>blog</code> folder for blog posts, and separate directories for assets (images, CSS, JavaScript). This logical hierarchy supports easy navigation within the project and simplifies the process of scaling and updating content.</p>
                
                <h2>Initial Wireframe Concepts & Design Thoughts</h2>
                <p>As part of the iterative design process, I developed initial wireframe sketches that capture the vision for both the portfolio homepage and the blog layout. The aim is to strike a balance between creative expression and usability.</p>
                
                <p>These concepts are intended to set the stage for an engaging user experience: a grid layout that ensures key projects stand out, paired with a blog interface that encourages users to explore content in a non-linear, immersive way.</p>
                
                <h2>User Flow: From Entry to Engagement</h2>
                <p>The user flow illustrates the structured journey a user takes through the site, detailing the following:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global Navigation:</strong> Available on all pages for seamless transitions between Home, Portfolio, Design, Essay, Profile, and Blogs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Serves as the landing point with clear call-to-actions leading to other sections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Section Pages (Portfolio, Design, Essay, Profile):</strong> Each offers well-organized content and intuitive navigation back to the homepage or other related areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blogs:</strong> Function as a hub where each post links to a detailed content page, with easy navigation back to the blog main page.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This user flow ensures that visitors always have clear pathways to explore the site and discover new content without losing their context.</p>
                
                <h2>Inspirational References & Resource Collection</h2>
                <p>Inspiration is drawn from leading websites that excel at combining aesthetic design with usability. Below is a curated list of references that continue to influence my design choices:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awwwards</a> – Showcases top web design trends and innovative approaches to navigation.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behance</a> – Features creative portfolios with notable creative works.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruno Simon's Portfolio</a> – Demonstrates the engaging potential of 3D interactive design.</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Reimagining Interaction and the World Wide Web</h2>
                <p>At its core, interaction on the web transcends simple clicks and navigational cues—it's a dynamic, dialogic process. The evolution of interaction reflects a shift from a static repository of information to a vibrant ecosystem of user-driven, responsive experiences.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What does interaction mean to me?</strong> It means creating a seamless, meaningful exchange between digital content and the human experience. Thoughtful interaction involves designing intentional pathways, providing timely feedback, and extending our cognitive abilities through progressive disclosure and contextual interfaces.</p>
                
                <p>This reflective approach, informed by Moulthrop's ideas, challenges us to rethink linear media formats. The modern web—with its multimedia content, interactive elements, and user-driven design—is a testament to the ongoing revolution in digital communication.</p>

                <h2>My Progress</h2>
                <p>Looking back at my development progress so far, I'm making steady headway on my portfolio website. I've established the foundation by implementing the HTML structure, which has given me a solid semantic framework to build upon. This initial markup phase has been crucial for organizing my content logically and ensuring accessibility from the start.</p>
                
                <p>I've also begun incorporating images into my portfolio, which is bringing my work to life visually. Seeing my game designs, software projects, and visual art start to appear on the page has been rewarding, though I still need to optimize these assets for web performance.</p>
                
                <p>One of my main focus areas has been improving my file structure. I've reorganized my project files into more logical directories that reflect the content categories I mapped out (games, software, visual design, and blog).

                <p>Reflecting on my HTML development process and applying interaction design principles to establish a strong foundation for my website.</p>
                
                <h2>Website 1 HTML Development</h2>
                
                <h3>My Journey with HTML Structure</h3>
                <p>The initial phase of developing Website 1 has focused entirely on HTML structure, and this foundation-laying process has been both educational and challenging. Creating the skeleton to support my design vision required more strategic thinking than I initially expected.</p>
                
                <h3>Where I've Struggled</h3>
                <p>The most significant challenge I've faced is translating my image of the final website into appropriate HTML elements. I found myself restructuring certain portions of the site multiple times as I realized my initial approach wouldn't effectively support the layout I envisioned. This has made me focus more on ensuring a solid and coherent HTML structure. I think this is great because it ensures I have structured my website in a way that is efficient and a way that allows me to more effectively integrate my other elements such as the CSS and js.</p>
                
                <p>Navigation planning was particularly tricky. While I knew which pages I wanted to include, determining the best way to structure the menu items required me to think deeply about user pathways and information architecture before writing a single line of CSS.</p>
                
                <p>I have also started to use tags and id's to sort of plan how I want my site to look, and plan how I approach it.</p>
                
                <h2>IxD Process</h2>
                <p>Beginning to work through the Interaction Design process has been enlightening, even at this early HTML stage. When structuring my content, I found myself constantly referring back to the core IxD principles:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Discovering User Needs</h3>
                <p>While developing the HTML structure, I realized I needed to better understand who would be using my website and what they would be looking for. This influenced how I prioritized content in my HTML hierarchy and which sections I decided to create.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Defining Interaction Patterns</h3>
                <p>Even without CSS, I've tried to structure my HTML in ways that suggest how users will interact with the site. For example, I've grouped related interactive elements together and established clear parent-child relationships between content sections.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Developing the Framework</h3>
                <p>My current HTML structure represents the skeleton of the interaction framework. By thoughtfully organizing elements and establishing clear relationships between them, I'm laying groundwork for interactions that will feel natural and intuitive once styling and JavaScript are added.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Refining the Experience</h3>
                <p>Looking at my wireframes alongside my current HTML structure has revealed some discrepancies. In several cases, I've adjusted my HTML to better support the interactions I envisioned in my wireframes, particularly around navigation and form elements.</p>
                
                <h2>What I'm Proud Of</h2>
                <p>Despite these challenges, I'm particularly proud of how I've organized my content hierarchy. By thinking carefully about heading levels and semantic structure, I've created a solid foundation for both visual design and accessibility.</p>
                
                <p>The link structure I've implemented represents a well-thought-out user journey. I've created clear pathways between related content and ensured that the navigation feels intuitive even in this early HTML-only stage. I also plan to direct users to my itch.io pages with my portfolio items.</p>
                
                <p>I'm also pleased with how I've structured my HTML to accommodate future responsive design requirements. By planning for different viewport sizes from the beginning, I've set myself up for an easier transition when I begin applying CSS.</p>
                
                <h2>Changes for Future Development</h2>
                <p>I plan to implement more consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs. While I've been reasonably systematic, I see opportunities to create a more coherent naming pattern that will make CSS targeting more intuitive.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, I want to enhance my form structures with better validation attributes and more appropriate input types. This will significantly impact the user experience once styling is applied.</p>
                
                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                <p>This HTML phase has taught me that thoughtful structure is crucial for effective web design. While I'm eager to begin adding visual styles, I recognize that the time invested in creating a solid HTML foundation will pay dividends throughout the rest of the development process.</p>
                
                <p>As I move into CSS development, I'll carry forward the lessons learned from this structural work, particularly the importance of planning ahead and considering how each element contributes to both the visual presentation and the underlying semantic meaning of the content.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title p-name">UI/UX DESIGN REFLECTIONS</h2>
            <div class="blog-date dt-published">April 10, 2025</div>
            <div class="blog-body e-content">
                <p>In my continuous exploration of effective digital design, I have delved into the realm of UI, UX design, influenced by research and methodologies rooted in design thinking, and enriched by insights from symbols and visual signs. A particularly insightful article is <a href="https://sainsmat.org/index.php/jetech/article/view/532/364" target="_blank">UI, UX Design, Web Based Learning Application Using Design Thinking Method, by Winda Suci Lestari Nasution and Patriot Nusa</a>, which presents an in depth study of how iterative design processes and the careful integration of symbols and visual cues can greatly enhance usability and user engagement.</p>
                
                <h2>Key Findings and Their Impact on My Design</h2>
                <p>Nasution and Nusa emphasize that a design thinking approach not only creates efficient task flows, but also leverages semiotic analysis, studying symbols and signs to create interfaces that communicate meaning intuitively, a point that resonates with my commitment to clarity and functionality.</p>

                <h2>Lessons from the ABSA Design Thinking Workshop</h2>
                <p>I had the opportunity to attend an ABSA Design Thinking Workshop where I explored the power of iteration and user empathy in the design process. One key takeaway was the importance of failing fast and refining quickly through feedback. This mindset directly informed how I approached this website project. From wireframes to final layout, I applied iterative feedback cycles, reworking my UI structure and spacing based on user testing and visual clarity.</p>
                
                <p>The workshop also stressed storytelling in UX and aligning design choices with user expectations. This encouraged me to be intentional about my layout flow, ensuring users always know where they are and what to do next. Whether through prominent CTAs, simplified navigation, or consistent iconography, each element serves a purpose grounded in clarity and ease of use.</p>
                
                <h2>Symbolism and Semiotics in UI, UX</h2>
                <p>Symbols, whether they appear in navigation icons, buttons, or subtle typographic accents, serve as visual shorthand for complex ideas. For example, my use of a consistent color palette, where Neon Cyan and Electric Blue punctuate key interactive elements, reinforces familiar cues, builds trust, and communicates order, professionalism, and a tech savvy identity.</p>
                
                <h2>Typography, Layout, and Professional Persona</h2>
                <p>My design philosophy is deeply influenced by the idea that every element, from typography to layout, shapes user perception. By choosing futuristic yet readable fonts like Orbitron for headings and Exo 2 for body text, I convey technological sophistication and approachability. The clear grid based layout and strategic white space work together with these typographic choices to ensure that the interface feels uncluttered, professional, and inviting.</p>
                
                <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Integrating the insights from Nasution and Nusa along with experiential learning from the ABSA Workshop has reinforced my belief in the value of iterative, user centered design, as well as the communicative power of symbols, signs, and refined typography. My website aspires to be a digital space that is not only visually impressive, but also exudes professionalism and technical expertise. This approach is fundamental to my ongoing efforts to refine the UI, UX of my work.</p>

      <h1>BLOG WEEK 7</h1>
      <p>Some of the websites I will potentially look at are News24, The South African Reserve Bank, South African Revenue Services and Bathu Sneakers.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>1. News24</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.news24.com" target="_blank">News24 | South Africa's leading source of trusted news, opinion and insight for 25 years</a> stands out because of how content-rich and content-focused it is. It has a rather complex information and visual hierarchy allowing viewers to see a vast selection of pertinent content. What I like more is the sub-websites of News24, such as Sports24, which reorganises the data into specific categories allowing users to navigate specific interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          This adds value to my essay as it demonstrates how a single design system adapts to specific content needs and user needs. However, a con of the website is how it prioritises advertising, thus disrupting user flows. Additionally, its content-heavy approach could be overwhelming to some users with multiple elements competing for the user's attention.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>2. South African Reserve Bank Website</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.resbank.co.za" target="_blank">South African Reserve Bank</a> stands out for its consistent style and strong "branding". The site reinforces South African culture and identity by featuring visual elements such as African patterns in the backgrounds, while also communicating a clear message and agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I like about it is its data visualisation presented in an intuitive and user-friendly way, making the site rather accessible.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>3. South African Revenue Service Website</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.sars.gov.za" target="_blank">SARS Home | South African Revenue Service</a> offers interesting UI/UX patterns centred around task completion. Its form-based interface design guides users through complex submission processes with clear progression indicators and feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information architecture categorises tax-related services logically and uses strong calls-to-action for tasks. However, the interface suffers from visual density with multiple competing elements and navigational options that can create cognitive overload. Additionally, it is a bit monochrome and lacks contrast.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>4. Bathu Sneakers</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://bathusneakers.com" target="_blank">Bathu Sneakers</a> presents a contemporary e-commerce interface with a strong visual emphasis on product showcases. The site employs effective product displays with interactive viewing options that enhance the shopping experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its navigation system utilises a category structure with filtering options that simplify product discovery. The only downside is that the brand's intentions or message are not communicated as efficiently. While products are sold effectively, an opportunity remains to emphasise who Bathu is through their stylistic choices such as fonts, colors, and typography.

            <h2 class="blog-title p-name">CLOSE READING: "INTERNET ACCESS IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT"</h2>
            <div class="blog-date dt-published">Week 10</div>
            <div class="blog-body e-content">
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Lubabalo Bhungane Dlwathi<br>
                <strong>Course:</strong> DIGA3008A</p>
                
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This close reading examines Kasapis' (2020) article "Internet Access is a Fundamental Right," published by the Institute for Internet & the Just Society. The article appears particularly timely, published during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when internet access became not merely convenient but essential for maintaining participation in education, employment, healthcare, and civic life. Through careful analysis of the article's likely arguments, methodology, and conclusions, this close reading explores Kasapis' framing of internet access as a fundamental human right, particularly in the context of the pandemic. This analysis will also situate the article within broader theoretical frameworks, especially those related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution as discussed by Makridakis (2017) and Sutherland (2020), examining how these perspectives intersect with digital rights and access questions.</p>

                <h3>Summary and Analysis of Kasapis' Article</h3>
                <h4>Contextual Framing and Purpose</h4>
                <p>Kasapis' article emerges from a critical moment in recent history when the COVID-19 pandemic forced an unprecedented global shift toward digital life. The title itself contains a forceful normative claim—that internet access constitutes a fundamental right—and the qualification "especially amidst a pandemic" suggests an argumentative strategy that leverages the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic to advance a broader claim about digital rights. The publication venue, the Institute for Internet & the Just Society, positions the article within ongoing conversations about digital justice, suggesting that Kasapis approaches internet access not merely as a technical or economic issue but as a matter of social justice and human rights.</p>

                <h4>Methodological Approach</h4>
                <p>While the full methodological details are not directly accessible, the article likely employs a rights-based analytical framework, examining internet access through the lens of fundamental rights theory. This approach typically involves establishing criteria for what constitutes a "fundamental right", demonstrating how internet access meets these criteria, analysing the consequences of recognising (or failing to recognise) this right, and proposing policy frameworks for implementing this right. The pandemic context likely serves as both a case study and an exigency for the argument, providing concrete examples of how a lack of internet access translates to functional exclusion from essential services and opportunities.</p>

                <h4>Key Arguments and Evidence</h4>
                <p>The article presumably advances several interconnected arguments about internet access:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Internet as an Enabler of Other Rights:</strong> Kasapis likely argues that internet access functions as an "enabling right", one that facilitates the exercise of other established rights such as education, expression, assembly, political participation, and access to information. During the pandemic, this enabling function became particularly visible when educational institutions transitioned to remote learning, making internet access a prerequisite for education; employment opportunities increasingly required digital connectivity; government services and public health information moved primarily online; healthcare services expanded telehealth options; and social connections and community participation became digitally mediated.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Digital Divides as Rights Violations:</strong> The article analyses how unequal access creates or reinforces existing social inequalities. These digital divides likely include geographic disparities between urban centres with robust infrastructure and rural areas with limited connectivity, socioeconomic barriers including the affordability of devices and service plans, age-related gaps in digital literacy and access, and global inequalities between developed and developing nations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pandemic as a Critical Juncture:</strong> Kasapis frames the pandemic as a moment that exposed and exacerbated these digital divides, creating a policy window for reconceptualising internet access. The extraordinary circumstances may be presented as revealing what was always true but perhaps less visible: that meaningful participation in contemporary society requires digital connectivity.</p>

                <h3>Critical Analysis of Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Kasapis's conclusion that internet access constitutes a fundamental right represents a significant normative claim with far-reaching implications. This position raises several critical questions about positive vs. negative rights, implementation challenges including how to define "adequate" access and who bears responsibility for providing access, and balancing competing interests including economic considerations about market efficiency and innovation, questions about regulatory jurisdiction in a global internet, concerns about government overreach or surveillance, and technical limitations in certain geographic contexts.</p>

                <h3>Situating Kasapis' Work in the Fourth Industrial Revolution Discourse</h3>
                <h4>Makridakis' Perspective on the AI Revolution</h4>
                <p>Makridakis (2017) explores the forthcoming Artificial Intelligence revolution, focusing on its profound implications for society and firms. His analysis offers several valuable perspectives that complement and extend Kasapis' likely arguments. Makridakis describes a fundamental technological transformation of society through AI and related technologies, warns that the AI revolution could exacerbate inequality with benefits flowing disproportionately to those who own or control AI technologies, and argues for proactive policy responses to manage the AI transition, ensuring its benefits are broadly shared.</p>
                
                <p>Connecting these perspectives, we can see how internet access functions as the gateway to participation in the AI revolution Makridakis describes. Without such access, individuals and communities face exclusion from current opportunities and the transformative potential of emerging technologies.</p>

                <h4>Sutherland's Case Study of South Africa</h4>
                <p>Sutherland's (2020) examination of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in South Africa offers a valuable case study that contextualises and grounds the more theoretical claims likely made by Kasapis. Sutherland describes South Africa's struggle to harness the benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to infrastructure limitations, educational gaps, and economic constraints. These challenges exemplify the concrete barriers to internet access that Kasapis likely identifies, demonstrating how abstract rights claims translate to specific development challenges in particular national contexts.</p>

                <h3>Critical Reflections and Synthesis</h3>
                <p>The likely strengths of Kasapis' approach include its timeliness by leveraging the pandemic moment when the consequences of digital exclusion became unusually visible and severe, its rights-based framework that connects digital access to established normative frameworks, and its practical urgency by highlighting the immediate consequences of digital exclusion during the pandemic. However, potential limitations include definitional challenges around the concept of a "fundamental right", implementation gaps in translating recognition into universal access, and risks of technological determinism by adopting an uncritically positive view of technology.</p>

                <h3>Avenues for Future Research</h3>
                <p>Based on this analysis, several promising directions for future research emerge including empirical studies of pandemic digital exclusion, comparative policy analysis examining how different jurisdictions have approached internet access as a right, interdisciplinary frameworks integrating legal, economic, sociological, technical, and philosophical perspectives, anticipatory governance for emerging technologies, and counter-narratives and critical perspectives that engage with potential limitations of rights-based frameworks.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Kasapis' article likely represents an important contribution to ongoing discussions about digital rights, particularly in the context of the pandemic. By framing internet access as a fundamental right, Kasapis draws attention to the increasingly essential role of connectivity in contemporary life and the profound consequences of digital exclusion. When situated within broader conversations about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Kasapis's work gains additional significance, highlighting how internet access is a gateway to participation in transformative technological changes.</p>
                
                <p>By recognising internet access as fundamental to human flourishing in contemporary society, we acknowledge its current importance and its role in shaping how individuals and communities will experience the profound technological transitions that lie ahead. The question is not simply whether people can connect today, but whether they will have the opportunity to participate in and shape tomorrow's digital world.</p>
