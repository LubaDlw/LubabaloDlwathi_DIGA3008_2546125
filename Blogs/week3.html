      <h1>BLOG WEEK 3</h1>
      
      <div>
        <p>Planning and organizing my portfolio website with focus on structure, user experience, and information architecture.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>My Goals for My Website</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>I want my portfolio website to showcase my diverse skills in game design, software development, and visual design work. My main goal is to present my projects and creations in a way that highlights my unique style and technical abilities. I need to develop intuitive navigation that allows visitors to explore my different design domains seamlessly. My site will feature interactive demonstrations of my game prototypes, code samples, and visual design work. I aim to guide potential clients or employers through my professional journey, showing the evolution of my skills and creative approach.</p>
          
          <h2>My Target User Analysis</h2>
          
          <p>My website primarily serves potential employers, clients, and fellow designers who are interested in my game, software, and visual design capabilities. These visitors have specific needs: quick access to my project highlights and technical skills; interactive examples that demonstrate my game mechanics and visual style; practical demonstrations of my problem-solving approach; and a portfolio organized to showcase both my specialized skills and versatility across different design disciplines.</p>
          
          <h2>My Content Mapping</h2>
          
          <h3>My Information Structure</h3>
          <p>I'll organize my content into these main categories reflecting my expertise areas:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Design Portfolio</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Game concepts and mechanics</li>
                <li>Development process documentation</li>
                <li>Link to itch.io games published</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Software Development Projects</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Web applications</li>
                <li>Link to actual websites</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visual Design Work</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>UI/UX design projects</li>
                <li>Illustrations and concept art</li>
                <li>Brand identity projects</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blog Page</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Make a book that the user can navigate to read blogs</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>My Information Architecture (IA)</h3>
          <p>Following the principles from the slides, I'll organize my content hierarchically:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Primary navigation for main categories (Games, Software, Visual, Blog)</li>
            <li>Secondary navigation within each category for projects/subcategories</li>
            <li>Card sorting with potential users to validate my categorization</li>
            <li>Clear labeling system using terminology familiar to my target audience</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>My User Experience Flow</h2>
          
          <h3>User Journey Mapping</h3>
          <p>My portfolio flow begins with an engaging introduction that showcases my best work across all disciplines. From there:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Landing Page:</strong> Featuring my strongest and latest projects</li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio Navigation:</strong> Allowing direct access to game, software, or visual design sections</li>
            <li><strong>Project Deep Dives:</strong> Detailed case studies of my process and problem-solving to show how i think and approach my designs</li>
            <li><strong>Contact and Resume:</strong> Professional information</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>My Interface Elements</h2>
          
          <h3>Navigation Components</h3>
          <p>Following the slides' categories, I'll implement:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Navigation:</strong> Main menu with clear icons for Games, Software, Visual, and Blog sections</li>
            <li><strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> Showing current location (e.g., Home > Games > Project Name)</li>
            <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> For my blog "book" interface to create an immersive reading experience</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Input Controls</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Clearly labeled call-to-action buttons for exploring projects</li>
            <li><strong>Toggles:</strong> For switching between grid/list views of projects</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> Direct manipulation of game demos and prototypes</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Informational Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tooltips:</strong> For explaining technical terms or providing context</li>
            <li><strong>Message Boxes:</strong> For form submission confirmation</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>My Progress</h2>
          
          <p>Looking back at my development progress so far, I'm making steady headway on my portfolio website. I've established the foundation by implementing the HTML structure, which has given me a solid semantic framework to build upon. This initial markup phase has been crucial for organizing my content logically and ensuring accessibility from the start.</p>
          
          <p>I've also begun incorporating images into my portfolio, which is bringing my work to life visually. Seeing my game designs, software projects, and visual art start to appear on the page has been rewarding, though I still need to optimize these assets for web performance.</p>
          
          <p>One of my main focus areas has been improving my file structure. I've reorganized my project files into more logical directories that reflect the content categories I mapped out (games, software, visual design, and blog). This cleaner organization will make it much easier to maintain the site as I add more projects and blog content over time.</p>
