      <h1>BLOG WEEK 7</h1>
      <p>Some of the websites I will potentially look at are News24, The South African Reserve Bank, South African Revenue Services and Bathu Sneakers.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>1. News24</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.news24.com" target="_blank">News24 | South Africa's leading source of trusted news, opinion and insight for 25 years</a> stands out because of how content-rich and content-focused it is. It has a rather complex information and visual hierarchy allowing viewers to see a vast selection of pertinent content. What I like more is the sub-websites of News24, such as Sports24, which reorganises the data into specific categories allowing users to navigate specific interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          This adds value to my essay as it demonstrates how a single design system adapts to specific content needs and user needs. However, a con of the website is how it prioritises advertising, thus disrupting user flows. Additionally, its content-heavy approach could be overwhelming to some users with multiple elements competing for the user's attention.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>2. South African Reserve Bank Website</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.resbank.co.za" target="_blank">South African Reserve Bank</a> stands out for its consistent style and strong "branding". The site reinforces South African culture and identity by featuring visual elements such as African patterns in the backgrounds, while also communicating a clear message and agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I like about it is its data visualisation presented in an intuitive and user-friendly way, making the site rather accessible.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>3. South African Revenue Service Website</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.sars.gov.za" target="_blank">SARS Home | South African Revenue Service</a> offers interesting UI/UX patterns centred around task completion. Its form-based interface design guides users through complex submission processes with clear progression indicators and feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information architecture categorises tax-related services logically and uses strong calls-to-action for tasks. However, the interface suffers from visual density with multiple competing elements and navigational options that can create cognitive overload. Additionally, it is a bit monochrome and lacks contrast.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>4. Bathu Sneakers</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://bathusneakers.com" target="_blank">Bathu Sneakers</a> presents a contemporary e-commerce interface with a strong visual emphasis on product showcases. The site employs effective product displays with interactive viewing options that enhance the shopping experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its navigation system utilises a category structure with filtering options that simplify product discovery. The only downside is that the brand’s intentions or message are not communicated as efficiently. While products are sold effectively, an opportunity remains to emphasise who Bathu is through their stylistic choices such as fonts, colors, and typography.
