      <h1>BLOG WEEK 4</h1>
      
      <div>
        <p>Reflecting on my HTML development process and applying interaction design principles to establish a strong foundation for my website.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Website 1 HTML Development</h2>
        
        <div>
          <h3>My Journey with HTML Structure</h3>
          <p>The initial phase of developing Website 1 has focused entirely on HTML structure, and this foundation-laying process has been both educational and challenging. Creating the skeleton to support my design vision required more strategic thinking than I initially expected.</p>
          
          <h3>Where I've Struggled</h3>
          <p>The most significant challenge I've faced is translating my image of the final website into appropriate HTML elements. I found myself restructuring certain portions of the site multiple times as I realized my initial approach wouldn't effectively support the layout I envisioned. This has made me focus more on ensuring a solid and coherent HTML structure. I think this is great because it ensures I have structured my website in a way that is efficient and a way that allows me to more effectively integrate my other elements such as the CSS and js.</p>
          
          <p>Navigation planning was particularly tricky. While I knew which pages I wanted to include, determining the best way to structure the menu items required me to think deeply about user pathways and information architecture before writing a single line of CSS.</p>
          
          <p>I have alos started to use tags and id's to sort of plan how I want my site to look, and plan how I approach it.</p>
          
          <h2>IxD Process</h2>
          <p>Beginning to work through the Interaction Design process has been enlightening, even at this early HTML stage. When structuring my content, I found myself constantly referring back to the core IxD principles:</p>
          
          <h3>1. Discovering User Needs</h3>
          <p>While developing the HTML structure, I realized I needed to better understand who would be using my website and what they would be looking for. This influenced how I prioritized content in my HTML hierarchy and which sections I decided to create.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Defining Interaction Patterns</h3>
          <p>Even without CSS, I've tried to structure my HTML in ways that suggest how users will interact with the site. For example, I've grouped related interactive elements together and established clear parent-child relationships between content sections.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Developing the Framework</h3>
          <p>My current HTML structure represents the skeleton of the interaction framework. By thoughtfully organizing elements and establishing clear relationships between them, I'm laying groundwork for interactions that will feel natural and intuitive once styling and JavaScript are added.</p>
          
          <h3>4. Refining the Experience</h3>
          <p>Looking at my wireframes alongside my current HTML structure has revealed some discrepancies. In several cases, I've adjusted my HTML to better support the interactions I envisioned in my wireframes, particularly around navigation and form elements.</p>
          
          <h2>What I'm Proud Of</h2>
          <p>Despite these challenges, I'm particularly proud of how I've organized my content hierarchy. By thinking carefully about heading levels and semantic structure, I've created a solid foundation for both visual design and accessibility.</p>
          
          <p>The link structure I've implemented represents a well-thought-out user journey. I've created clear pathways between related content and ensured that the navigation feels intuitive even in this early HTML-only stage. I also plan to direct users to my itch.io pages with my portfolio items.</p>
          
          <p>I'm also pleased with how I've structured my HTML to accommodate future responsive design requirements. By planning for different viewport sizes from the beginning, I've set myself up for an easier transition when I begin applying CSS.</p>
          
          <h2>Changes for Future Development</h2>
          <p>I plan to implement more consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs. While I've been reasonably systematic, I see opportunities to create a more coherent naming pattern that will make CSS targeting more intuitive.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, I want to enhance my form structures with better validation attributes and more appropriate input types. This will significantly impact the user experience once styling is applied.</p>
          
          <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
          <p>This HTML phase has taught me that thoughtful structure is crucial for effective web design. While I'm eager to begin adding visual styles, I recognize that the time invested in creating a solid HTML foundation will pay dividends throughout the rest of the development process.</p>
          
          <p>As I move into CSS development, I'll carry forward the lessons learned from this structural work, particularly the importance of planning ahead and considering how each element contributes to both the visual presentation and the underlying semantic meaning of the content.</p>
