        <h2>Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>Setting up GitHub and publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages was a straightforward experience. The process involved creating a repository, configuring the appropriate settings, and pushing my HTML files to the main branch. What I found particularly valuable was how GitHub abstracts away the complexity of web hosting while still providing powerful version control features. Being able to deploy something on the internet is very exciting and I look forward to creating much more and putting out full-on projects through GitHub.</p>
          
          <h2>Reflection on Readings: Turing's 1950 Paper and the Internet Today</h2>
          
          <p>Reading Alan Turing's <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em> (1950) was a fascinating experience. In his paper, Turing proposed the idea of machines being capable of thinking, introducing what we now call the Turing Test. While the paper was written decades before the internet as we know it, its implications are still relevant today.</p>
          
          <p>Diving deeper into Turing's paper, I was struck by his methodical dismantling of objections to machine intelligence. His famous "imitation game" setup, where a human interrogator attempts to determine which of two unseen participants is a machine and which is human, presents a compelling operational definition of intelligence that sidesteps philosophical debates about consciousness. Turing's approach feels remarkably modern in its focus on observable behavior rather than internal mechanisms, a pragmatism that resonates with current approaches to AI evaluation.</p>
          
          <p>Particularly prescient was Turing's acknowledgment that machines might think differently from humans, noting that "the interrogator might not get the right conclusion about which was which." This insight anticipated today's reality where AI systems often produce unexpected solutions that don't follow human reasoning patterns. For example, AlphaGo's famous "Move 37" against Lee Sedol in 2016 was initially thought to be a mistake by human experts but proved to be brilliant, showcasing exactly the kind of machine thinking that Turing predicted might confound human judges.</p>
          
          <p>With AI chatbots, recommendation algorithms, and machine learning models shaping our digital experiences, we see Turing's ideas come to life. The modern internet is driven by intelligent systems that personalize content, predict user behavior, and automate complex tasks. My experience with GitHub reflects this evolution, automation in version control, AI-powered code suggestions (like GitHub Copilot), and seamless deployment processes that make development more efficient.</p>
          
          <p>Turing's work made me think about how the internet has evolved from a static information repository to an interactive, intelligent network that adapts to user needs. The question of whether machines can think has transformed into discussions on AI ethics, automation, and the impact of AI on human creativity, topics I find particularly interesting as I explore software development.</p>
          
          <h2>Hypertext Theory and Today's Internet</h2>
          
          <p>Exploring the theoretical underpinnings of hypertext reveals fascinating connections to our contemporary digital experience. Vannevar Bush's 1945 essay "As We May Think" introduced the concept of the "memex," a theoretical proto-hypertext system designed to supplement human memory by allowing users to create trails of linked information. This revolutionary concept predated the web by decades but anticipated its fundamental structure.</p>
          
          <p>Ted Nelson, who coined the term "hypertext" in the 1960s, envisioned a far more radical system than what eventually emerged. His Xanadu project proposed a network where documents would be perpetually accessible, with visible bi-directional links, version tracking, and a micropayment system for authors, a vision that remains partially unrealized even today. Nelson's concept of "transclusion," where content could be included in multiple documents while maintaining a single source, foreshadowed modern content management systems and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in software development.</p>
          
          <p>What's fascinating is how today's internet only partially fulfills these early visions. The Web implemented unidirectional links rather than Nelson's bidirectional ones, leading to what some theorists call the "lost in hyperspace" problem, where users can navigate to content but cannot easily discover what links to it. This limitation has been partially addressed through search engines, which effectively create dynamic, ad-hoc link structures based on relevance algorithms.</p>
          
          <p>Social media platforms have implemented a version of bidirectional linking through their notification systems, where users are informed when their content is referenced, creating the connection traceability that Nelson envisioned for Xanadu. Meanwhile, technologies like WebMentions are attempting to bring true bidirectional linking to the open web.</p>
          
          <p>The theoretical concept of "hypertext consciousness," proposed by literary theorist Katherine Hayles, suggests that prolonged exposure to hypertext environments restructures human cognition toward associative, non-linear thinking patterns. This perspective offers an interesting lens for examining how our thinking has evolved alongside hypertext systems like the web. The fragmented, attention-switching mindset many of us now experience may be, in part, a cognitive adaptation to the hypertext environment we inhabit daily.</p>
          
          <h2>Interesting Discoveries About the History of the Web</h2>
          
          <p>As I went into the history of the web, I came across several fascinating milestones. Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 revolutionized communication, making information more accessible than ever before. Before the web, the internet was primarily a research and military tool, but Berners-Lee's introduction of hypertext, URLs, and browsers made it very user-friendly.</p>
          
          <p>What I found particularly illuminating was learning about the CERN document "Information Management: A Proposal" that Berners-Lee submitted in March 1989, which initially received the lukewarm annotation "Vague but exciting" from his supervisor. This modest beginning for what would become a world-changing technology demonstrates how even revolutionary ideas can start with uncertain reception.</p>
          
          <p>Another fascinating discovery was the early browser wars between Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, which significantly shaped web standards and development practices. The competition drove rapid innovation but also created fragmentation as each browser implemented proprietary features, forcing developers to create multiple versions of websites, a challenge that echoes in today's cross-browser compatibility concerns.</p>
          
          <p>I was also intrigued to learn about early web design aesthetics, from the text-only interfaces of the earliest browsers like Lynx to the visually chaotic, table-based layouts of the mid-1990s. The evolution from those early designs to today's responsive, accessibility-focused interfaces reflects not just technological advancement but shifting cultural values around inclusivity and user experience.</p>
          
          <p>The rapid growth of social media and cloud computing has also drastically changed how we use the web. What started as a simple way to share documents and academic research has evolved into an ecosystem of interconnected platforms that for the most part shape how we live our lives.</p>
          
          <h2>My Goals for This Course</h2>
          
          <p>This course is an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of web development, software engineering, and the broader implications of technology. My goals include:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Gaining proficiency in version control and collaborative coding using GitHub, particularly focusing on branching strategies and pull request workflows that facilitate team development.</li>
            <li>Sharpening my foundational knowledge in web design, with specific attention to responsive design principles and accessibility standards that ensure inclusive user experiences.</li>
            <li>Developing a critical perspective on how web technologies shape and are shaped by social factors, exploring the ethical dimensions of design choices.</li>
            <li>Building practical skills in modern web development frameworks and tools that will translate directly to professional environments.</li>
            <li>Creating a portfolio of work that demonstrates both technical competency and thoughtful engagement with the theoretical aspects of web development.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>As someone interested in becoming a software developer and contributing to innovative projects, this course will help me build a strong foundation. I'm particularly excited about applying these skills to real-world projects, including my student app and potential future research in AI-driven education. By connecting theoretical understanding with practical implementation, I hope to develop not just as a coder but as a technologist who can thoughtfully shape the future of digital experiences.</p>
