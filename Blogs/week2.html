      <!-- Reflection on Moulthrop's Essay -->
      <section>
        <h2>Reflecting on Moulthrop, S. (2003) “You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)”</h2>
        <p>
          Moulthrop’s work invites us to reconsider the promises of hypertext in transforming the way we interact with media. Even though his paper originally focused on hypertext as a revolution in how information is consumed and created, the underlying ideas speak powerfully to the internet today. By applying McLuhan’s tetrad of media effects—enhancement, obsolescence, retrieval, and reversal—Moulthrop anticipated many of the tensions we now experience in digital communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How does it speak to the Internet today?</strong> Moulthrop’s foresight is evident in the democratization of publishing, the non-linearity of digital narratives, and the ongoing tension between user freedom and algorithmic control. As we grapple with both the benefits and pitfalls of modern platforms, his framework provides a valuable lens through which to assess our digital environment.

      <!-- Folder Structure & URL Scheme Discussion -->
      <section>
        <h2>Folder Structure and URL Scheme: Decisions & Insights</h2>
        <p>
          In building my website, thoughtful consideration has been given to both the folder structure and URL scheme. Maintaining a clean, scalable system is essential for efficient development and for ensuring an intuitive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Folder Structure:</strong> The site’s files are organized into clear directories—<code>index.html</code> in the root, a dedicated <code>blog</code> folder for blog posts, and separate directories for assets (images, CSS, JavaScript). This logical hierarchy supports easy navigation within the project and simplifies the process of scaling and updating content.
        </p>

      <!-- Initial Wireframes & Design Concepts -->
      <section>
        <h2>Initial Wireframe Concepts & Design Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          As part of the iterative design process, I developed initial wireframe sketches that capture the vision for both the portfolio homepage and the blog layout. The aim is to strike a balance between creative expression and usability.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/Wireframes/2.png" alt="Initial Wireframe Concept 1" />
          <figcaption>Wireframe Concept 1 – A grid layout emphasizing visual impact and intuitive navigation.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/Wireframes/6.png" alt="Initial Wireframe Concept 2" />
          <figcaption>Wireframe Concept 2 – A book-like interface for blog posts, designed to promote narrative exploration.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          These concepts are intended to set the stage for an engaging user experience: a grid layout that ensures key projects stand out, paired with a blog interface that encourages users to explore content in a non-linear, immersive way.

      <!-- User Flow Diagram and Explanation -->
      <section>
        <h2>User Flow: From Entry to Engagement</h2>
        <p>
          Below is a diagram of my user flow. This flow illustrates the structured journey a user takes through the site:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/userflow.png" alt="User Flow Diagram" />
          <figcaption>User Flow Diagram – Outlining global navigation, homepage entry, and pathways through portfolio, design, essay, profile, and blog sections.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The diagram details the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Global Navigation:</strong> Available on all pages for seamless transitions between Home, Portfolio, Design, Essay, Profile, and Blogs.</li>
          <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Serves as the landing point with clear call-to-actions leading to other sections.</li>
          <li><strong>Section Pages (Portfolio, Design, Essay, Profile):</strong> Each offers well-organized content and intuitive navigation back to the homepage or other related areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Blogs:</strong> Function as a hub where each post links to a detailed content page, with easy navigation back to the blog main page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This user flow ensures that visitors always have clear pathways to explore the site and discover new content without losing their context.

      <!-- Reflection on Interaction and the World Wide Web -->
      <section>
        <h2>Reimagining Interaction and the World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>
          At its core, interaction on the web transcends simple clicks and navigational cues—it's a dynamic, dialogic process. The evolution of interaction reflects a shift from a static repository of information to a vibrant ecosystem of user-driven, responsive experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does interaction mean to me?</strong> It means creating a seamless, meaningful exchange between digital content and the human experience. Thoughtful interaction involves designing intentional pathways, providing timely feedback, and extending our cognitive abilities through progressive disclosure and contextual interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reflective approach, informed by Moulthrop’s ideas, challenges us to rethink linear media formats. The modern web—with its multimedia content, interactive elements, and user-driven design—is a testament to the ongoing revolution in digital communication.
