        <p>Exploring GitHub Pages and reflecting on Turing's 1950 paper in the context of the modern internet.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up GitHub and Publishing to Pages</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>Setting up GitHub and publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages was a straightforward experience. Being able to deploy something on the internet is very exciting and I look forward to creating much more and putting out full-on projects through GitHub.</p>
          
          <h2>Reflection on Readings: Turing's 1950 Paper and the Internet Today</h2>
          
          <p>Reading Alan Turing's <em>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</em> (1950) was a fascinating experience. In his paper, Turing proposed the idea of machines being capable of thinking, introducing what we now call the Turing Test. While the paper was written decades before the internet as we know it, its implications are still relevant today.</p>
          
          <p>With AI chatbots, recommendation algorithms, and machine learning models shaping our digital experiences, we see Turing's ideas come to life. The modern internet is driven by intelligent systems that personalize content, predict user behaviour, and automate complex tasks. My experience with GitHub reflects this evolution—automation in version control, AI-powered code suggestions, and seamless deployment processes that make development more efficient.</p>
          
          <p>Turing's work made me think about how the internet has evolved from a static information repository to an interactive, intelligent network that adapts to user needs. The question of whether machines can think has transformed into discussions on AI ethics, automation, and the impact of AI on human creativity—topics I find particularly interesting as I explore software development.</p>
          
          <h2>Interesting Discoveries About the History of the Web</h2>
          
          <p>As I went into the history of the web, I came across several fascinating milestones. Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 revolutionized communication, making information more accessible than ever before. Before the web, the internet was primarily a research and military tool, but Berners-Lee's introduction of hypertext, URLs, and browsers etc made it very user-friendly.</p>
          
          <p>The rapid growth of social media and cloud computing has also drastically changed how we use the web. What started as a simple way to share documents and academic research has evolved into an ecosystem of interconnected platforms that for the most part shape how we live our lives.</p>
          
          <h2>My Goals for This Course</h2>
          
          <p>This course is an opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of web development, software engineering, and the broader implications of technology. My goals include:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Gaining proficiency in version control and collaborative coding using GitHub.</li>
            <li>Sharpening my foundational knowledge in web design.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>As someone interested in becoming a software developer and contributing to innovative projects, this course will help me build a strong foundation. I'm particularly excited about applying these skills to real-world projects, including my student app and potential future research in AI-driven education.</p>
